This code trace all eip values from start to end of a programe using ptrace and single stepping.

Example usage:

$ make
$ ./proto ls
$ audacity 

Then import 'log' as raw audio using 16bits and 2 channels (big endian).
First channel contains EIP's lsb and allows to visualize local loops. Second channels shows where in the memoryspace the program is through time.
